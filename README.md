# mos6502

This is an emulator for the venerable MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor written in Scala.

The emulator is working with all instructions and addressing modes having been implemented.

There are a few working examples under the `code` folder. The assembler being used is called `crasm` and is available under Ubuntu/Mint.
