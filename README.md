# mos6502

This is an emulator for the venerable MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor written in Scala.

Currently, the emulator is working and emulation for all instructions and addressing modes has been coded. The assembler has yet to be started.

There are a few working examples under the `code` folder. The assembler being used is called `crasm` and is available under Ubuntu/Mint.
